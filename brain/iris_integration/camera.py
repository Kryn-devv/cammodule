"""The robot's eye as IRIS tools — seeing, recognising and remembering faces.

Goes to ``iris/app/tools/devices/camera.py``. Companion to ``devices/face.py``,
which drives the OLED eyes: that one is the face the robot *shows*, this one is
the faces it *sees*.

WHAT RUNS WHERE, AND WHY
The ESP32-CAM is a camera and nothing more. It cannot recognise a face —
Espressif's ESP-WHO / ESP-DL dropped the original ESP32, and the Arduino core
removed the old ``fd_forward.h`` face headers after 3.0.7 — so it sends frames
and the two hard questions are answered here, differently:

* **"who am I?"** is answered locally, by comparing the face against samples
  the robot has been shown. No cloud call: it is a closed comparison, it has
  to work when the internet is down, and most hosted vision models will
  refuse to identify a named individual anyway.
* **"what is this?"** goes to a vision model, because naming an arbitrary
  object is open-ended and that is exactly what those models are good at.

The vision call needs no change to the LLM gateway. ``CloudLLMProvider.generate``
builds its request as ``_build_messages(prompt, system_prompt, kwargs["messages"])``
and posts it to an OpenAI-compatible ``/chat/completions``, so passing a
ready-made ``messages`` list carries the standard ``image_url`` content block
straight through.

See ``docs/CAMERA.md`` for wiring, and the cammodule repo for the firmware.
